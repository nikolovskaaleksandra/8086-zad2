# 8086---Zadaca2
For the microprocessor system implemented in the previous task, write a routine that will detect when it is pressed key on the matrix keyboard, then decodes the value corresponding to that key (hexadecimal digit) and shows the value on the seven-segment display. In case of error, the the display should show the character H. The output port address of the seven-segment display is 90h, keyboard output port is 80h and keyboard input port is 81h.

**Subject**

Microcomputer's systems

**Built With**

This project is built using the following tools:

â€¢	[Emu8086](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/): Assembler and emulator for the Intel 8086 microprocessor.

**Getting Started**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

**Prerequisites**

In order to run this project you need:

A working computer
Connection to internet
Setup

**How to Run**

To run the program, you need an 8086 emulator or assembler. You can use emulators like DOSBox or TASM (Turbo Assembler). Here's how to run the program using EMU8086:
1.	Download and install Emu8086 from [here](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/).
2.	Clone this repository to your local machine.
3.	Open Emu8086 and load the zadaca2.asm file.
4.	Assemble the code by pressing the Assemble button.
5.	Run the program by pressing the Run button or by pressing F10.
